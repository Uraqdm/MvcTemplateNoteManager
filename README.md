# About this app
This application was created for the purpose of my acquaintance with ASP.NET Core MVC and further deepening my knowledge and using them in other projects.
Most of the code was created using templates (since I am not yet able to write the same application from scratch on my own). In the future, I plan to write something similar without using templates, using knowledge and a small code base from this application</p>

# Using this app
The application can be used as a simple diary, in which you can mark small tasks and set a date for them (for example, a deadline or the beginning of a meeting).
